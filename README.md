This project is a to-do list web-app that allows the user to create a list of things they need to accomplish giving them a way to organize their schedule

URL to main webapp: https://ucsb-cs56-u-to-do.herokuapp.com

1. Clone the repo
2. Extract the zip of the repo you cloned into your local file path
3. From the folder in your file path, execute the command: "mvn spring-boot:run"
4. Go to localhost:8080 in your browser.

 - In order to run the application on Heroku:

 - Once you are on the main page of the webapp do the following to test its features:
1. Enter an email address in the field labeled "Username." (if you already have an account, you should be able to login with your own username and password by select the button "Sign In")
